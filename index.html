                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Asmat Kaur Taunque, a driven and accomplished Computer Science major at the California Institute of Technology (Class of 2025), where I maintain a Major GPA of 4.2. I possess a fervent enthusiasm for the world of technology, and my passion for continuous learning drives me to explore and excel in various programming languages and web technologies.

                    As a creative and innovative developer, I find great satisfaction in bringing ideas to life through coding and problem-solving. My project experiences have exposed me to a diverse array of challenges, from building complex physics-based games like the "Slime" game in C, which can be found <a href="https://zauth14.github.io/zauth14.github.io-slimegame/">here</a>, to crafting an engaging e-commerce webpage for Squishmallows, utilizing server-side JSON, client-side JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The pursuit of excellence has led me to collaborate on a variety of projects, including the development of classic games like Pacman, Space Invaders, Breakout, Stars, and a spring simulation.

                    Beyond my academic pursuits, I possess a deep appreciation for the arts and indulge in creative expression through music and theatre. I love singing and playing the guitar, finding solace and inspiration in the melodies I create. My participation in theatre allows me to explore and convey diverse narratives, making every performance a memorable experience. 

                    While I relish the excitement of technology and the arts, I am equally devoted to my personal connections and values. Spending quality time with my friends and family enriches my life, providing the foundation for my growth and resilience. Moreover, my international experience in basketball has instilled in me the virtues of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, culminating in the achievement of the Division B championship at the FIBA Asia Cup. My sports achievements have garnered recognition in numerous newspaper articles, and I am honored to have received the prestigious Davis Scholarship, a testament to my dedication to academic excellence. Here is a link to my website representing my athletic content: <a href="https://asmatkaurtaunque.com/">https://asmatkaurtaunque.com/</a>

                    During my time as a student researcher at the University of Utah, I delved into optimizing the kinetics of a chlorination reaction for nuclear waste reuse, co-authoring a scientific paper that was published in Springer journals.

                    I am eager to contribute my talents, knowledge, and passion to meaningful projects that can make a positive impact on society through efficiency and innovation in the IT sector. 

                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to exploring new opportunities for growth, collaboration, and making a difference in the world. Please feel free to reach out for any potential collaborations or discussions.
