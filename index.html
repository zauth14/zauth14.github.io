            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello! I am Asmat Kaur Taunque, a rising junior at the California Institute of Technology, and am majoring in Computer Science. My major GPA  is 4.2. During my time at Caltech, I have gained proficiency in 8 programming languages:
                Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (client-side), JSON (server-side), Haskell, and OCaml. I have also worked on a range of projects from developing games with complex physics engines and key handling 
                to building APIs and websites for e-commerce. On LinkedIn, I have successfully scored in the top 5% in the Javascript, CSS, Front-end-Development skill tests, the top 15% in the OOP skill test, and the top 30% in the C skill test.
                In the summer of 2022, I delved into optimizing the kinetics of a chlorination reaction aimed at the recycling of nuclear waste as a student researcher and co-authored a scientific paper in Springer Journals. 
                Outside of academic pursuits, I enjoy playing basketball, singing, playing the guitar, and doing theatre. I represented India at the U16 FIBA Asia Cup in 2017 and have received many awards and accolades for excellence in sports. For more about 
                my basketball journey, please click <a href="https://asmatkaurtaunque.com/">here</a>. In addition to this, I am also passionate about singing, playing the guitar, and doing theatre. I acted in the recent Caltech production - 
                The Sunrise from the Moon - as the female lead, Annaliese Gardner. Through art and athletics, I am able to channel creativity and clear thinking into my academic pursuits and thus, be a more efficient and 
                productive coder. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to exploring new opportunities for growth and collaboration! Please feel free to reach out for any potential collaborations or discussions.</p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <ul id="project_list">
                <li>Slime Game
                <p>In the spring of 2023, I collaborated with 3 to develop a game in C from scratch. Completed in 4 weeks, this game
                   includes a complex physics engine, key handling, and animations. My key responsibilities included spear-heading the level design,
                   gravity implementations, implementing and rendering animations, and rendering the background score + sound effects. Unfortunately, since this was a 
                   group effort, the backend code cannot be shared. However, a demo of this game is available <a href="https://zauth14.github.io/zauth14.github.io-slimegame/">here</a>.
                </p></li>
                <li>Pac-Man Game
                <p>I collaborated with a partner to code this game. My key responsibilities included implementing abstractions (such as creating our own 
                    data structures), key-handling, and developing the demo game. Again, since this was a collaborative assignment, the backend code cannot be
                    shared; however, a demo can be found <a href="https://zauth14.github.io/zauth14.github.io-pacman/">here</a>.
                </p>
                </li>
                <li>Breakout Game
                <p>I collaborated with a group of 3 to code this game. My key responsibilities included developing the pickups (including the physics of it) and implementation of 
                   the demo game. Since this was a collaborative assignment, the backend cannot be shared; however, the demo can be found <a href="https://zauth14.github.io/zauth14.github.io-breakout/">here</a>.
                </p></li>
                <li>Space Invaders Game
                <p>I collaborated with a group of 3 to code this game. My key responsibilities included implementing abstractions (we created our own
                    data structures) and implementing the physics forces used in the main demo. Since this was a collaborative assignment, the backend cannot be shared; 
                    however, the demo can be found <a href="https://zauth14.github.io/zauth14.github.io-space_invaders/">here</a>.</p></li>
                <li>Squishmallow Store Website
                    <p>I created an e-commerce website using server-side JSON, client-side JavaScript,HTML, and CSS. Although the final website was my own work, I collaborated with a partner on the server-side JSON, such that, we had a shared project backend. In the backend, my key contributions included implementing a POST endpoint for becoming a member of the loyalty program, a GET endpoint for an FAQ page, and a POST endpoint to add items to the cart. Features I implemented in the front-end include a main view with all the webpage's products, a single-product view for the selected product, and a cart view. The main page has a sorting filter, the cart view displays all selected items, with the total prices calculated, and the single-product view includes buttons to increase/decrease quantities of the product and add it to the cart. The webpage also includes a POST endpoint for contacting the store and a pop-up for becoming a loyal customer. A YouTube video demonstrating the functionality of the webpage will be posted shortly!</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>I have also independently developed this portfolio to showcase my work and web development skills. Please feel free to reach out and provide any feedback on how I can improve! </p></li>
